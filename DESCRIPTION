Title: Stable Phylogenetic Leaf Address Encoding
Version: 0.0.1
Description: This package supports Stable Phylogenetic Leaf Address Encoding (splade). It provides functions to convert a phylogenetic tree to a phylogenetic leaf address encoding (folio). This encoding allows taxa to be added to an existing tree in a stable manner such that the previously defined leaf addresses do not change. A set of addresses (a folio) is extended with weights on edges to form a foliox object. The package contains utilities for manipulating foliox objects.
